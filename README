BufferView is a wrapper around the DataView class from the Typed Arrays
specification: https://www.khronos.org/registry/typedarray/specs/1.0/

DataView has a minimal and awkward API. BufferView improves the API by
keeping track of the current offset and allowing the specification of a
default endianness.  BufferView also adds UTF-8 encoding and decoding
support.

I've been thinking about ways to read and write multiple values at a
time, and am considering implementing methods like Python's (and Perl's)
pack() and unpack(). 

If I get more ambitious, I may try to make BufferView work with binary
strings or with Node's Buffer class.

Right now this code is mostly untested.  But see the example in the test
directory: it lists the contents of a zip file.

Note that Firefox 4 does not support DataView.  But you can emulate it
with https://github.com/davidflanagan/DataView.js
